The screening will be followed by a question and answer session featuring the directors of each film. \nIncluded in the showcase are the following short films: \nPink and Blue, directed by Carmen LoBue, tells the heartwarming story of the joys and sorrows of first-time parenting for a trans couple of color. \nHow to Raise a Black Boy, directed by Justice Jamal Jones, is an experimental fairytale dedicated to the modern black boy in which four children disappear one night, and find themselves on a fantastical journey to break the curses of black boyhood. \nIce Cold, directed by Sekiya Dorsett, also the moderator of the post-screening Q&A, is about a blushing bride having the best and worst day of her life. \nF**k Em Right Back (FERB), directed by Harris Doran, is about a queer Black aspiring Baltimore rapper who must outwit his vengeful day-job boss to avoid getting fired after accidentally eating an edible. \nHold Onto Me, directed by Te Shima Brennan, follows Mother LaTravious as she tries to hold her nonprofit organization together and struggles with health issues. \nPanelists: \nTe Shima Brennen (They/Them), director of Hold Onto Me, is a visual storyteller and journalist based in Brooklyn. As an emerging documentary filmmaker, they aim to tell nuanced stories about Black, queer, and trans people as they navigate institutions and systems not built to support them. Currently, Te Shima is co-directing a documentary that follows an ailing Black trans matriarch who is struggling to inculcate the values of education and survival in her community before she runs out of time. They are also producing a documentary that follows a revolutionary artist from Yonkers who is leading the charge to create a healthier future for generations of Black community members affected by redlining. Te Shima was the 2022-23 recipient of a Magic Grant from the Brown Institute for Media Innovation for their pilot project, “TRANSforming Journalism.” They were also a 2022 Reuters Institute Fellow at the University of Oxford, where they researched how journalists can build trust in trans communities as a gateway to telling nuanced stories about them. Te Shima completed their Masters of Science in Journalism with a documentary specialization at Columbia University’s School of Journalism, and is currently a reporting fellow at the Pulitzer Center. Their work has been featured at numerous festivals, domestically and abroad, including NewFest, the Pan African Film Festival, BFI Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival, Roze Filmdagen, and the Inside Out Film Festival. \nHarris Doran (He/Him) is the director and writer of F**k Em Right Back (FERB), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2022 and received a nomination for the Grand Jury Prize. The film won many awards including “Best Comedy” at Aspen Shortsfest, qualifying the film for Oscar consideration. Doran also produced D. Smith’s feature documentary Kokomo City, executive produced by Lena Waithe, which premiered in the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, where it won both the NEXT Innovator Award and the Audience Award. Kokomo City had its international premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Panorama Audience Award. The film was bought by Magnolia Pictures to be released in theaters Summer 2023. Harris was shortlisted for the Film Independent Spirit Awards’ “Someone to Watch Award” for his feature film Beauty Mark, which earned the “Breakout Performance” Jury Prize for lead actress at its LA Film Festival premiere, the “Best Ultra lndie” film award at the Woodstock Film Festival, and the “Audience Award” for Best Feature Film at the Austin Film Festival. \nSekiya Dorsett (She/Her, MFA ’18), director of Ice Cold, is a GLAAD award-winning filmmaker who centers a multidimensional Black experience in her work. Bringing into sharper focus the lives of Black women, queer folks, the working class, and their intersections, Dorsett’s body of work is notable for its intimate storytelling. Her first feature, 2017’s The Revival: Women and the Word, was screened across the country on tour with Black lesbian poets and is distributed by Women Make Movies. In 2019, she directed a four-episode documentary series, Stonewall 50: The Revolution, for NBC News and NBCOut. The series’ deep dive into the historic uprising won a GLAAD Media Award and the award for Excellence in Digital Journalism from NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ Journalists. Recently, she was one of the cinematographers who brought In Our Mother’s Gardens (Netflix), a work of intergenerational Black woman confessional storytelling, to critical and audience acclaim. Her films have screened at Tribeca Film Festival, Urbanworld Film Festival, the Brooklyn Museum, Frameline Film Fest, and Outfest Film Festival, and have been written about in publications including HuffPost, MIC, BuzzFeed, and Essence. She holds a Master of Fine Arts from Hunter College. Her next project, I LOVE BED-STUY, is a docu-fiction feature-length love story and love letter to the iconic Brooklyn neighborhood. \nJustice Jamal Jones (She/He/They), director of How to Raise a Black Boy, is a filmmaker, actor, and writer based in New York City. As a Black Queer Alchemist, they integrate Black feminist queer theory and Black diasporic spirituality, such as Vodou (Voodoo), into their work. Their debut film, How to Raise a Black Boy, is a reimagining of Jones’s childhood, linking their boyhood to their identity as a non-binary artist. The film was screened internationally at more than 30 film festivals, earning 10 awards. Justice was also a 2021 Sundance Ignite Fellow, and in 2022 they were commissioned to direct for MTV and Calvin Klein.

Doris Fish and the Rise of Drag. The acclaimed book provides a vivid new history of drag as told through the life of pioneering drag queen Doris Fish. The author will be in conversation with local drag artist John Epperson aka Lypsinka. \nIn the 1970s, queer people were often despised and drag queens were considered scary; and yet, according to Craig Seligman, it was during that era that Doris Fish (born Philip Mills in 1952) rose to stardom through his painting and drag artistry. He was a leader of the generation that prepared the world not just for drag queens on TV, but also for a society generally more tolerant and accepting of LGBTQ+ individuals. How did we get from there to here? In Who Does That Bitch Think She Is? Craig Seligman looks at the life of Doris Fish in order to deliver some answers. From the rise of drag shows to the obsession with “camp” to the onset of AIDS, Seligman adds needed color and insight to this era of LGBTQ+ history, revealing the origins and evolution of drag. \nFilled with interviews, letters, and more, Who Does That Bitch Think She Is? revisits the places and people Doris Fish knew best—allowing readers to understand the historical markers and shifts his life both encompassed and represented for the wider queer community, past and present. \nAt this event, in conversation with NYC-based drag artist Lypsinka, Seligman will discuss the life of this outrageous performer and artist, and reflect on the legacy of Doris Fish as a guide and inspiration in the current fight to stop the backlash against drag. \nAccording to Jim Piechota, writing for EDGE Media Network, Seligman’s new book is a “fantastic, immersive history of drag… mandatory reading for drag fans and queens.” \nPanelists: \nCraig Seligman has contributed hundreds of articles to a wide variety of magazines, journals, newspapers, and websites including The New Yorker, The New Republic, The New York Times Book Review, The Threepenny Review, Artforum, Bookforum, Salon and The Village Voice. From 2006 to 2013, he was the lead book critic for Bloomberg News. He has been an editor at The New Yorker, Food & Wine (executive editor), and Salon (books editor), and has written criticism for the San Francisco Examiner (where he was a staff film and book critic in the 1980s). In 2004, he published Sontag and Kael: Opposites Attract Me, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle award in criticism. In 2016, Seligman was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in the field of biography. \nJohn Epperson aka Lypsinka is an American drag artist, actor, pianist, vocalist, composer, lyricist, and author. As the female character Lypsinka, Epperson is renowned for lip-syncing to the songs and dialogue of iconic screen sirens and obscure audio clips—bringing new meaning to the lines ventriloquized through juxtaposition and gender reversal. Lypsinka’s performances have been hailed as “expressionistic and hallucinatory one-act audio wonders” and Lypsinka’s takes on Joan Crawford, Gloria Swanson, Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, and Lauren Bacall have earned praise from critics and fans alike. Epperson also works as an actor outside of performing as Lypsinka, appearing in films including Black Swan and Kinsey. Epperson has also been a pianist with the American Ballet Theater off and on for several decades. \nThis event is co-sponsored by the CUNY LGBTQ Advisory Council and it is made possible by the generous support of the New York City Council and the CUNY LGBTQ Consortium.","2023-06-15T00:21:49Z","Roosevelt House, 47-49 East 65th St., New York, NY, 10065, United States","0","CONFIRMED","Craig Seligman - Who Does That Bitch Think She Is?
