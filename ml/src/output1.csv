After the event employers and students (even those who were not able to attend) will be allowed to submit preferences. While we will do our best to match accordingly, but we cannot guarantee preferences will be met.&nbsp;<i>Do not sign-up for a Brazen account beforehand.

As promised I am sending you a calendar invite and Zoom meeting instructions for your garden meeting, which is coming up at 11 am this coming Monday, April 20.\n\n\nBe aware that this meeting is only going to last 40 minutes, which is the length of time that we can use Zoom for free to meet!  At the meeting, we hope to discuss and clarify the roles that you have assigned each other for the opening of the garden, whenever the pandemic-related restrictions are lifted.\n\n\nAt this meeting, we are also going to welcome my GreenThumb colleague Babbie Dunnington, who will provide us advice on what plants we have available to give you to plant.  Attached is a sheet that she has created of the many plants that are available.\n\n\nAttached also is a quick and handy guide for gardeners about the different tools you can use to hold virtual meetings during this time--as I mentioned in my previous blast to you this morning, you can join our informational webinar about holding virtual meetings at 12 noon today--in just a few minutes!  Here is the link for the webinar:  https://zoom.us/j/656486344?pwd=TExibk5lZVNJZzlpcXIzWTU3ZkkxZz09, and here is the link for the slide deck of informational materials for today's webinar: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B-G2Ua7xGjRUoZxjhpDhblQBMi-fzc1ccyFHMVxD6NE/edit#slide=id.p4.\n\n\nBelow is the information you need to join the garden meeting on April 20.  When you click on the Zoom link, you should be able to open Zoom either in your browser or download it to open as a separate application on your computer.  Do this whenever you are ready to join a Zoom meeting.\n\n\nPlease let me know anytime if you have questions or issues?  All the best --Amber\n\n\nAmber Qureshi is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.\n\n\nTopic: Amber Qureshi's Personal Meeting Room\n\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://zoom.us/j/3476501955\n\n\nMeeting ID: 347 650 1955\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ________________________________\nFrom: Qureshi, Amber (Parks)\nSent: Tuesday, March 31, 2020 2:51 PM\nTo: Brown, Kenneth; Urdanivia, Claudia (Parks); 'ladyannsmith@aol.com'; 'ray.buksh@yahoo.com'; 'Carla Sanchez'; 'salicea3@schools.nyc.gov'; 'Alvarez Daniel'; '3carriej69@gmail.com'; 'ivalerio@schools.nyc.gov'; 'Roman Evelyn'; 'Warchol Jonathon'; 'enidperalta@gmail.com'; 'Roger Mason'; 'angel7111954@gmail.com'; 'merwinholmes@gmail.com'; 'gdhunter007@gmail.com'; 'Jahmaine75@gmail.com'; 'topazz1125@yahoo.com'; 'tasherajames@yahoo.com'\nCc: Dunnington, Babbie (Parks)\nSubject: RE: Morris Garden - Next Steps for 2020!\n\n\n\nDear Friends at Morris Garden:\n\n\nThanks so much to all of you who are a part of the garden, and all of you who were able to be a part of the meeting yesterday.  I'm going to try to summarize the conversation below.\n\n\nNew garden name: The Bean Morris Garden, in honor of garden leader Carrie's son, nicknamed Bean, who left this world in December.  This new name seems to me to be a great first decision for the group to make.  Unless there are any objections from the group, garden will proceed with this new name.\n\n\nScheduling of garden clean-up event and the opening event to come after it: Group decided that it cannot make a plan to convene in the garden until the social-distancing restrictions in NYC have ended.  Once we have a sense of when members can come together in the garden, a date will be set for the opening event and a volunteer clean-up day to come first.  We **hope** that the garden could open around the beginning of June.\n\n\nOpening Event: Several Bean Morris members attended our Event Planning Workshop last month and are ready to plan a great event to open the garden, whenever it opens.  Attached is a handout from the workshop.  Feel free to form a sub-committee among yourselves and discuss ideas, assign roles, responsibilities, purchases, etc. for the opening event--this is a great time to get as much planning as possible done before the event is scheduled.\n\n\nNext meeting: We scheduled our next meeting for Monday, April 20, at 11 am, and we would like to use the application Zoom to make this next meeting a video conference, for those who are able to use Zoom.  We have been using Zoom for our office meetings, it's free and easy, and in this time of isolation it has been pretty useful!  You can download the app on your phone or your computer, you can get it ahead of time or at the linkhere<https://zoom.us/download>, and I will send you a link to click on at the time of the meeting.  Zoom also has an audio-only function, so that you can use any telephone to call in and join the meeting by voice, and I will send you the number for that as well.  I believe that Ms. Grace offered to be secretary for the group, so she will take minutes for the meeting and share with the group afterwards--Ms. Grace, just let me know if that plan changes?\n\n\nSpecial guest appearance: At that next meeting, we have invited our GreenThumb colleague Babbie Dunnington, who will give us some useful advice on what plants are best to plant in the garden, especially in the non-edible raised beds, where the garden cannot plant food.  Seven-foot sunflowers were suggested at our meeting, and that is a great idea, but there are more ideas for you to see, and those of us who can join the next meeting on the computer will have a chance to look at more options together!  Babbie can also help the garden get the plants, including plants we can give you from GreenThumb and also grant options. In advance of the meeting, we will send around a list of possibilities, with pictures.\n\n\nGarden hazard: Ms Hutchinson mentioned that there is a wooden plank in the garden that is a safety hazard, that was left after the garden renovation was done.  Our Parks operations teams are not visiting non-active gardens at the moment, but we will look into it before the garden opens again.\n\n\nI think that is about it for the meeting, though anyone else please chime in if I missed anything.  Save space in your calendars for 4/20 at 11 am--I will get a Zoom link and send a calendar invitation out to you in the next few days.  I look forward to having you there.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nAmber Qureshi, GreenThumb\n\n\n\n\n  ________________________________\nFrom: Qureshi, Amber (Parks)\nSent: Tuesday, March 31, 2020 11:13 AM\nTo: Brown, Kenneth; Urdanivia, Claudia (Parks); 'ladyannsmith@aol.com'; 'ray.buksh@yahoo.com'; 'Carla Sanchez'; 'salicea3@schools.nyc.gov'; 'Alvarez Daniel'; '3carriej69@gmail.com'; 'ivalerio@schools.nyc.gov'; 'Roman Evelyn'; 'Warchol Jonathon'; 'enidperalta@gmail.com'; 'Roger Mason'; 'angel7111954@gmail.com'; 'merwinholmes@gmail.com'; 'gdhunter007@gmail.com'; 'Jahmaine75@gmail.com'; 'topazz1125@yahoo.com'; 'tasherajames@yahoo.com'\nSubject: RE: Morris Garden - Next Steps for 2020!\n\n\n\nMany thanks for this on-the-ground reporting, Ken!
