The talk will delve into the importance of transparency and explainability, showcasing methods such as attention visualization and model distillation that provide critical insights into model behavior. We will address the control of generated content through techniques including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), token penalization, external moderation systems, and prompt engineering. Finally, we will tackle the issue of bias mitigation, emphasizing the need for transparency in the pre-training data used for these billion-parameter models, diverse and representative data, as well as pre-, in-, and post-processing techniques to ensure fairness in LLMs.\n\nThese considerations have taken on heightened significance in light of the recently proposed EU AI Act, the first major regulatory framework for AI. Although the Act originates in Europe, its reach is globally impacting organizations that interact with European entities or serve European customers. In addition, it might set a precedent that could inspire similar legislation in other regions, thereby broadening its implications.\n\nMoreover, understanding these critical aspects of responsible AI not only aids in the creation of LLMs that are ethical and safe for real-world applications but also accelerates the development process for downstream tasks. Since these techniques can be used as an aid for developers to swiftly identify and correct issues, improving model performance and reliability. \n\n\nOr One tap mobile:\n    +16465588656,,91698483070# US (New York)\n    +16469313860,,91698483070# US\n\nOr join by phone:\n    Dial(for higher quality, dial a number based on your current location):\n        US: +1 646 558 8656  or +1 646 931 3860  or +1 309 205 3325  or +1 312 626 6799  or +1 301 715 8592  or +1 305 224 1968  or +1 386 347 5053  or +1 507 473 4847  or +1 564 217 2000  or +1 669 444 9171  or +1 669 900 6833  or +1 689 278 1000  or +1 719 359 4580  or +1 253 205 0468  or +1 253 215 8782  or +1 346 248 7799  or +1 360 209 5623 \n    Webinar ID: 916 9848 3070\n    International numbers available: https://acm-org.zoom.us/u/aeI40qIKu7\n\n","2023-11-03T21:38:10Z","https://acm-org.zoom.us/w/91698483070?tk=KZvKwM6S7KsnB_Br7_qG7F-VcPhLqPZ2qI1S5vTP87g.DQMAAAAVWafPfhZBNmZVUUhTU1RiR2RhenlJYmNpSHpBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&uuid=WN_-KiH9D2LTZWT0pXdzl9Fug","0","CONFIRMED","Ethical and Responsible Large Language Models: Challenges and Best Practices","OPAQUE"
